To Do App

A simple To Do App that allows you to add tasks you wish to accomplish and have the ability to cross them off and delete them.

With a simple display it gives you the ability to add whatever task you like in literary format and to add it below with the add button.

Once done you get the option to either cross it out with the check box on the left.

Once done, an x mark will appear on the far right of the box which once clicked will delete the task.

Summary:

This will be my third JavaScript Project as of now. 

HTML structure: The app includes input elements for adding tasks, a button for adding tasks, and a container for displaying the tasks. Each task has a checkbox for marking as complete, a label for the task description, and an icon for deleting the task.

CSS styling: The app's appearance is controlled by CSS, including styles for the app's layout, colors, and fonts. The task container has a CSS class called .task that sets its display, alignment, background color, width, and positioning.

JavaScript functionality: The app relies on JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks.

The app's functionality mainly revolves around the manipulation of DOM elements to create, modify, and delete tasks dynamically based on user input and actions.
